For this problem, we have 2 types of queries you can perform on a List:

1. Insert y at index x:

Insert x y

2. Delete the element at index x:

Delete x 

Given a list, L, of N integers, perform Q queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, print the modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N (the initial number of elements in L).
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing L.
The third line contains an integer, Q (the number of queries).
The 2Q subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:

If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains two space separated integers x,y, and the value y must be inserted into L at index x.
If the first line of a query contains the String Delete, then the second line contains index x, whose element must be deleted from L.
Constraints
1<=N<=4000
1<=q<=4000

Each element in is a 32-bit integer.
Output Format

Print the updated list L as a single line of space-separated integers.
